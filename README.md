# GraphQL - Let's put REST to rest
This is the repository for the corresponding workshop to be covered during dotNetConf 2018 in Medellin,  CO.

## Where we were?

### 0_1_Initial
- ~~Defined a set of prerequisites.~~
- ~~Created the solution.~~ 
- ~~Created the server project and added all the basic files and dependencies we need.~~ 
- ~~Got a dumb GraphiQL interface.~~

### 0_2_Server_Basic
- ~~Created a class library project to handle our Issues logic.~~
- ~~Created two models: `User` and `Issue`.~~
- ~~Following a service repository pattern, we created the corresponding interfaces for those entities and implemented them.~~
- ~~Registered all the services in the .NET Core DI container.~~

### 0_3_Library_Basic

- ~~Checkpoint for section 0~~

### 1_1_Queries

- ~~Created GraphQL types for each entity.~~
- ~~Created the query and the schema.~~
- ~~Added new types and some utilities to the DI container.~~
- ~~GraphiQL started playing with us.~~

### 1_2_Types_Schemas_Simple_Queries

- ~~Added a general query and one with arguments.~~
- ~~Learned how Fragments and Directives work.~~

### 1_3_Arguments_Fragments_Directives

- ~~Checkpoint for section 1.~~

### 2_1_Mutations

- ~~Created Input Type for new mutation and added new service method for Issue creation.~~
- ~~Created corresponding Graph type.~~
- ~~Created mutation, upgraded schema, and registered new types.~~
- ~~Ran new mutation using input variables.~~

### 2_2_Create_Issue

- ~~Added logic for initial state and a state change inside the issues model.~~
- ~~Added the corresponding field in the Graph type.~~
- ~~Put new methods to deal with that state change on issues service interface and implementation class.~~
- ~~Added the new operation to mutations class.~~
- ~~Verified we can start progress by executing the mutation.~~

### 2_3_Update_Status

- ~~Checkpoint for section 2.~~

### 3_1_Subscriptions

- Created an event model and its corresponding graph type.
- Created a service interface and its implementation for these events.
- Updated the Issues service to trigger the events.
- Created the respective subscription and upgraded the schema to utilize it.
- Updated the DI container.
- Tested the subscriptions on different browser windows. 

## 3_2_Create_Issue_Subscription

This is the end of section 3. 

There's a lot of other cool things you can try from this point:

- Use the Bogus library to generate fake data and populate the properties of the user we didn't touch, like Avatar, Email and so on.
- Try to change the implementation of the service to use a real DB persistance with EF Core, so you can see data coming and going in your database.
- Host this service on an Azure Linux machine and share your API with the world.
- Consume the API with a client like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).
- Any other you can think of... ðŸ˜Ž

Feel free to fork or create issues on the repo. I'll try to take a look as soon as I can.

Cheers!
